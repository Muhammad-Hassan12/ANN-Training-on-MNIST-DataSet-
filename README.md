# ANN Model on MNIST DataSet
This repository consist "ANN" Model training on the MNIST Dataset. Its an example of training a simple ANN model. This repository consist step by step guide!
## Model
I have included the Pre-Trained ANN AI-Model "Captcha_Identifier.h5" and also as "Captcha_Identifier.keras". The efficiency of model is 98.90%
## Disclaimer!
The Dataset I used is "mnist" from keras!
Also this Model is not very sutiable for the identification since it is trained as ANN not CNN(which is suitable for this type of task)!
## Future Plan
In Future, I will upload a the same dataset trained on CNN Network!
